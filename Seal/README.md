# Overview

Seal was a toy language that I was hoping to use to learn more about creating a compiler.

It compiles .sea files into NASM files, and uses NASM as an assembler, while using GCC as the linker.

The parsing for this is very basic and ameteurish, and I likely wouldn't have gotten too far on the ASM side of things either at the time.

But it worked, and was a really good experiment.
