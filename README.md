# Overview

This repo's purpose is simply to preserve some old code and projects, purely for sentimental reasons.

## Projects

Note: Some of the 2014 projects were written in D, using Xaramin Studio (formerly known as MonoDevelop) using a very, very outdated D plugin.
Thankfully it seems most of the projects have their compiled output with them, because don't expect to easily be able to compile any of these things yourself.

Note: I've provided decompiled source files for any projects that are missing their original source code.

* Super Hidden File Creator(2011) - 12 year old me was being a script kiddie, trying to look cool.

* JPlatformer(2013) - My very first game project. This is "Alpha 1.0", the final version of the original C# version.

* StackPack(2013) - A relatively successful Minecraft mod which could store stacks of items and blocks into a "StackPack".

* JASM2(2014) - The oldest surviving version (that I know of right now) of JASM: The Jaster Assembly Language.

* JDLL_D(2014) - JDLL but for D. This is actually significantly different from the C# version.

* Parsing(2014) - Code where I was starting to learn how to perform lexical, and to an extent syntax analysis by following a BNF schema.

* Seal(2014) - A toy language that compiles into a native exe.

* Seal2(2014) - A second attempt the Seal language.

* SFML/JCity(2014) - A WIP multiplayer "city-builder" game.

* SFML/JDLL_SFML(2014) - A helper library for SFML.

* SFML/SFML_Skeleton(2014) - A skeleton project I used to use for quickly setting up a new SFML project.

* SFML/JPlatformer(2014) - The most complete D version of JPlatformer, has a few interesting things about it.
