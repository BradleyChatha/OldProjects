# Overview

Stackpack was a Minecraft mod I made back in 2013, originally for version 1.4.7, but this was the final codebase for version 1.6

The idea of stack pack was that you could compress any vanilla stack of 64 blocks or items into a "StackPack", which could
then be turned back into its original form. I.E This was "compressed cobblstone" before it was cool, and for everything.

I was still pretty new to programming, let alone modding, so I couldn't really implement many of the things I wanted to do, so
abandoned it to work on other projects I was capable of at the time (and had more passion for).

Similar to JPlatformer, the original source code is lost to time, so I've included a decompiled source via Java-Decompiler.

I learned most of my modding knowledge from a guy named "Wooley", I think?
