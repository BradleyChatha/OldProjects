# Overview

A few mutually unrelated projects where I was learning how to parse custom data formats via lexical, and to some extent syntax analysis.

What I learned from these experimental projects was the basis of my ability to create recursive parsers, and in general all of my custom
text-based formats. It's really sad, but really nostalgic to see that this is where that all started.

Recursive_Parsing_2 is a bit odd though, was I following a tutorial for that one?
