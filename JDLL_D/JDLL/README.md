# Overview

This was a helper library, similar to the C# JDLL, to help me with my D code.

It mostly seems to revolve around Binary IO, as that's something I was really into experimenting with at the time.

It appears that I also ported over the `IContentProcessor` stuff from the C# DLL in the form of `JPak`.

I think `util.d` was just a file where I could practice writing algorithms, considering it was 2014 this was still early enough
where I would've wanted to make sure I knew these things. Everyone starts somewhere and all that.

I don't know why, but I get that "It feels like yesterday" kind of feeling when looking at this codebase.

I think I actually wrote a decent chunk of this during a period of time where my internet wasn't working.
